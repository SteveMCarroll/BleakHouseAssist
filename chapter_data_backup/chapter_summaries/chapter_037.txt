Chapter 37: Jarndyce and Jarndyce

The focus returns to the Chancery Court and Richard's complete destruction. Richard is now entirely consumed by his obsession with the Jarndyce and Jarndyce lawsuit. Mr. Vholes, his vampiric lawyer, is systematically draining Richard of every penny while encouraging his delusions about the case. Vholes speaks in his characteristic whisper, always suggesting new developments, new possibilities, new reasons to pursue the case further and spend more money.

Richard's health is visibly deteriorating. The obsession is destroying him physically as well as financially and mentally. He's thin, feverish-looking, unable to focus on anything except the lawsuit. His army career has been abandoned—everything is subordinated to the case. He lives, breathes, and thinks of nothing but Jarndyce and Jarndyce. The case has become his entire existence.

Richard's relationship with Mr. Jarndyce has completely broken down. Richard now believes that Jarndyce is working against his interests in the lawsuit, that Jarndyce is perhaps even trying to cheat him. These suspicions are completely unfounded—Jarndyce wants nothing to do with the case and has only tried to protect Richard from it—but Richard's paranoia has progressed too far. He sees enemies everywhere and can't recognize that Vholes is the real parasite destroying him while Jarndyce tried to save him.

The chapter shows the lawsuit's mechanism of destruction in its final stages. Richard is following exactly the path of so many ruined suitors before him—wasting his money, health, and relationships in pursuit of an inheritance that will never materialize. Everyone around him can see what's happening, but Richard himself is blind to it. The case has taken possession of him completely. He's like Tom Jarndyce before him, driven to desperation by this endless lawsuit. The tragedy is that Richard was explicitly warned, was given every opportunity to escape this fate, but still walked straight into the trap. The chapter is painful to read because the destruction is so complete and so inevitable.
