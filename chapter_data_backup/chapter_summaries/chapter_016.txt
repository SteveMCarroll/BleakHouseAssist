Chapter 16: Tom-all-Alone's

The narrative shifts to describe Tom-all-Alone's, a horrific slum in London. This ruined property was once part of the Jarndyce estate but has fallen into complete decay due to the endless Chancery lawsuit—no one can maintain it or improve it because ownership is perpetually in dispute. The area has become a breeding ground for disease, crime, and desperate poverty. Jo, the crossing-sweeper, lives here among the ruins.

Dickens provides a powerful description of the slum's conditions: collapsing buildings, filth, disease, families crowded into single rooms, children growing up in squalor with no hope of education or escape. The chapter makes clear that Tom-all-Alone's is not just a personal tragedy but a social danger—the diseases bred in such slums spread throughout society, affecting rich and poor alike. "What connexion can there be," Dickens asks rhetorically, between the fashionable world and this desperate place? The answer: disease, crime, and moral corruption spread from such slums to infect all of society.

Mr. Bucket and Mr. Snagsby visit Tom-all-Alone's to find and question Jo again about the veiled lady. Their visit shows the vast gulf between respectable London and this underworld of poverty. Jo is terrified of authority figures and tries to hide. When they find him, he can tell them little—he's too frightened and confused. The constant refrain of "move on" is repeated—Jo is always being told to move on by police and authorities, but he has nowhere to go.

The chapter serves as Dickens's social commentary on urban poverty and the failure of institutions like Chancery. Tom-all-Alone's exists because the legal system has made the property unusable while the lawsuit drags on. The human cost is devastating: generations born and dying in squalor. The chapter title refers to Tom Jarndyce, whose despair over the lawsuit led to his suicide, and whose property has now become this hellish slum—a monument to Chancery's destructiveness.
