Chapter 30: Esther's Narrative

This is one of the novel's most critical chapters. Esther narrates a momentous turn of events: Jo, the sick crossing-sweeper, has been brought to Bleak House. He's desperately ill with fever (smallpox or typhus) and has nowhere else to go. Despite the danger of contagion, Esther in her compassion takes responsibility for caring for Jo. She won't turn away a dying child, regardless of the risk to herself.

Charley, Esther's devoted maid, helps care for Jo. Between them, they try to make the sick boy comfortable and nurse him back to health. But Jo's illness is contagious, and both Esther and Charley are exposed to it. Charley falls ill first, and Esther nurses her with the same devotion Charley has shown to Esther. Charley recovers, but then Esther herself contracts the disease.

Esther becomes seriously, dangerously ill. The chapter follows her through the fever's worst stages—the delirium, the physical suffering, the uncertainty about whether she'll survive. During her illness, Esther is isolated from others to prevent further contagion. She's cared for by medical professionals and by Charley (who, having had the disease, can't catch it again), but she's separated from Ada, from Mr. Jarndyce, from everyone else she loves.

The chapter's ending is ominous: Esther survives the fever, but there are strong hints that she's been disfigured by the disease. Smallpox often left severe scarring, and Esther realizes that her appearance has been dramatically altered. She hasn't yet seen her face in a mirror, but she knows from the reactions of others and from what she can feel that her beauty is gone. This is a major turning point: Esther's characteristic modest contentment is about to be tested in the severest way, and her future prospects—including any hope of marriage—seem to have been destroyed by her selfless act of caring for Jo.
