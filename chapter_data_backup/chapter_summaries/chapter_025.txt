Chapter 25: Mrs. Snagsby Sees It All

This chapter focuses on Mrs. Snagsby's paranoid jealousy, which has reached absurd heights. Mrs. Snagsby has convinced herself that there's some terrible secret connecting her innocent husband to Jo, the crossing-sweeper. She imagines elaborate conspiracies and hidden relationships, none of which have any basis in reality. Her jealousy has made her see sinister meaning in every innocent action.

Mrs. Snagsby follows her husband, questions him constantly, and creates domestic misery with her unfounded suspicions. She examines every word he says for hidden meaning, watches his every movement, and has turned their household into a place of tension and accusation. Poor Mr. Snagsby, who has done nothing wrong and only tried to show Christian kindness to a desperate child, finds himself living in a nightmare of suspicion.

The chapter satirizes baseless jealousy and the damage it causes. Mrs. Snagsby "sees it all"—the chapter's title is ironic because she sees nothing accurately. Her imagination has created an entirely false narrative. She's convinced herself that Jo represents some shameful secret in her husband's past, when in reality Jo is simply a poor boy that Snagsby has tried to help out of compassion.

The comic grotesqueness of Mrs. Snagsby's jealousy doesn't diminish the real suffering it causes. Mr. Snagsby is a gentle, timid man being tormented in his own home. He can't explain things to his wife's satisfaction because there's nothing to explain—no evidence can disprove imaginings that exist only in Mrs. Snagsby's mind. The chapter also shows how Jo, the innocent victim, continues to be a source of trouble and attention he never wanted. Multiple people's lives are being disrupted by investigations and suspicions surrounding this one sick, homeless child who only wanted to sweep crossings and survive.
