Chapter 2: In Fashion

The narrative shifts from foggy London and the Court of Chancery to Chesney Wold in Lincolnshire, the estate of the Dedlock family. The chapter introduces the aristocratic world, which Dickens suggests is not so different from Chancery—both are worlds of "precedent and usage," sleeping beauties waiting to be awakened. The weather at Chesney Wold is as dreary as in London: incessant rain, sodden grounds, melancholy atmosphere.

Lady Dedlock is the central figure, described as a woman of great beauty who has conquered the fashionable world but now suffers from profound boredom and exhaustion. She has "been bored to death" at Chesney Wold and has come to London before departing for Paris. Her character is established as one of exhausted composure, worn-out placidity, and fatigue that cannot be ruffled by interest or satisfaction. She is perfectly well-bred but emotionally frozen.

Sir Leicester Dedlock, her husband, is introduced as an honorable but absurdly proud baronet who believes the world might survive without hills but not without Dedlocks. He is twenty years older than his wife, ceremonious, stately, and holds his wife's beauty in the highest estimation. He married her for love despite whispers that she had no family background. The chapter establishes the Ghost's Walk terrace at Chesney Wold, foreshadowing family disaster.

The crucial dramatic moment occurs when Mr. Tulkinghorn, the Dedlocks' family lawyer (described as rusty, rich, and keeper of noble secrets), visits to read legal papers related to the Jarndyce case. When Lady Dedlock sees a particular handwriting on one of the documents, she reacts with uncharacteristic emotion, asking "Who copied that?" before nearly fainting. Mr. Tulkinghorn immediately becomes suspicious. This reaction establishes the central mystery: Lady Dedlock has a hidden past connected to this handwriting, and Tulkinghorn will investigate it. The chapter masterfully sets up the aristocratic world and plants the seed of the novel's major secret.
