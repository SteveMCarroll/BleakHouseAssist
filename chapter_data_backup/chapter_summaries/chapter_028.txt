Chapter 28: The Ironmaster

Mr. Rouncewell the ironmaster returns to Chesney Wold, bringing his son Watt with him. Watt has fallen in love with Rosa, Lady Dedlock's young maid, and wants to marry her. The ironmaster comes to propose a plan: he wants Rosa to receive a proper education so that she can be a suitable wife for his son. He'll pay for everything—he has the money and resources to give Rosa opportunities she could never have otherwise.

Sir Leicester is profoundly offended by this proposal. The idea that a servant could be educated to be suitable for a position above her birth violates his entire worldview. In Sir Leicester's aristocratic philosophy, people are born to their station and should remain in it. The notion that education and money could make Rosa "equal" to the Rouncewell family strikes him as a dangerous attack on the social order itself.

The scene crystallizes the conflict between the old aristocratic order and the new industrial middle class. Sir Leicester represents inherited wealth, ancient family lineage, and a fixed social hierarchy. Mr. Rouncewell represents self-made wealth, meritocracy, and social mobility. Rouncewell is respectful but firm—he's asking for permission but doesn't really need it. His wealth and power make him Sir Leicester's equal or even superior in practical terms, whatever the differences in birth might be.

Lady Dedlock, caught in the middle, is sympathetic to Rosa but doesn't want to offend Sir Leicester. The proposal is politely declined, though this creates tension. The chapter illustrates Dickens's theme of social change: the old landed aristocracy is declining in power and relevance, while the industrial middle class is rising. Men like Rouncewell the ironmaster are the future—practical, hardworking, wealthy through their own efforts—while men like Sir Leicester represent a passing world. This changing social order is happening whether the aristocracy approves or not.
