Chapter 42: In Mr. Tulkinghorn's Chambers

The investigation continues with more questioning and examination of evidence. Mr. Bucket pursues various leads, interviewing people and cross-checking their statements. Grandfather Smallweed is involved, searching through Tulkinghorn's papers and documents, looking for anything valuable or useful. He's more interested in profit than justice, seeing the murder as an opportunity to acquire valuable papers and information.

Various parties are trying to locate and secure documents that Tulkinghorn held. The lawyer kept extensive records and correspondence related to his many clients and investigations. Now that he's dead, there's a scramble to control these papers. Some want to protect secrets, others want to exploit information, and still others simply want to understand what Tulkinghorn knew.

Mr. Bucket continues to observe and deduce. He's watching how people react, what they're searching for, who seems nervous or evasive. His investigation is as much about reading human behavior as it is about physical evidence. He's patient, methodical, and increasingly confident that he's closing in on the truth.

The chapter shows the complexity of Tulkinghorn's professional life and the many threads that connected him to different worlds. His murder has created chaos because so many people depended on his discretion and his services. Now that he's gone, secrets are at risk of exposure, and various parties are maneuvering to protect their interests. The investigation is revealing not just who killed Tulkinghorn but also the extent of his influence and the many secrets he held.
