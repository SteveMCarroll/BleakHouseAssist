Chapter 24: An Appeal Case

The narrative returns to the Chancery Court and focuses on Richard's complete descent into lawsuit obsession. Richard has hired Mr. Vholes as his lawyer. Vholes is presented as a vampiric figure—respectable-looking, dressed in black, speaking in a dry whisper, but fundamentally a predator who lives by draining his clients of money and hope. Unlike the obviously corrupt or incompetent lawyers, Vholes appears proper and professional, which makes him more dangerous.

Vholes has three daughters and an aged father to support, which he constantly mentions as justification for his fees. But this appeal to sympathy is hollow—Vholes simply uses his family obligations as an excuse to extract every possible penny from his clients. He encourages Richard's obsession with the lawsuit, telling him there are always new developments, new possibilities, new reasons to pursue the case and spend more money. Vholes never tells Richard the truth: that the case is hopeless and destructive.

Mr. Jarndyce is horrified when he learns Richard has hired Vholes. Jarndyce knows what this means—Vholes will systematically drain Richard of every penny and encourage his worst tendencies. Jarndyce tries to warn Richard, but Richard sees this as interference and becomes defensive and suspicious. The rift between Richard and Jarndyce widens. Richard increasingly believes that Jarndyce is trying to cheat him out of his rightful expectations from the lawsuit.

The chapter shows the lawsuit's destructive mechanism in full operation: Richard is obsessed, Vholes is profiting, and Richard's health, finances, and relationships are all being destroyed. The case has become Richard's entire world. He talks of nothing else, thinks of nothing else, and is spending money he doesn't have in pursuit of a fortune that will never materialize. The tragedy is that Richard has been explicitly warned by everyone around him, has seen examples of ruin, but still cannot resist the case's attraction. He's like an addict, unable to stop even as the habit destroys him.
