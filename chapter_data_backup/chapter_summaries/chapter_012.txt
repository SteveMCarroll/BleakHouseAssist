Chapter 12: On the Watch

Mr. Tulkinghorn enlists the help of Mr. Bucket, a detective, to investigate the mysterious veiled lady who visited Nemo's grave. Bucket is introduced as a shrewd, methodical investigator who notices everything and misses nothing. He has an almost supernatural ability to appear and disappear, to know things without being told, and to put together pieces of evidence that others miss. He represents the new professional police detective—a relatively recent development in Victorian society.

Bucket and Tulkinghorn question Jo, the crossing-sweeper, about the veiled lady. Jo describes her as best he can—a lady in black with a veil, who gave him a sovereign and asked to see where "the berrying man" (Nemo) lived and was buried. Jo can't identify her, but his description confirms Tulkinghorn's suspicions. Mr. Snagsby is also present and becomes increasingly entangled in this mysterious business, much to his discomfort.

Mrs. Snagsby's jealousy and suspicion of her husband intensifies. She notices his involvement with Jo and with various mysterious comings and goings, and her imagination runs wild with baseless accusations. She becomes convinced her innocent husband is hiding something terrible. The chapter shows Snagsby trapped between Tulkinghorn's investigation and his wife's unfounded jealousy—an innocent man caught up in events he doesn't understand. The investigation into Lady Dedlock's secret is tightening, with Bucket methodically gathering evidence that will eventually expose her past.
