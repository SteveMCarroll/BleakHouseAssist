Chapter 23: Esther's Narrative

Esther narrates this chapter, which contains a significant moment: Mr. Guppy's formal proposal of marriage to Esther. Guppy arrives at Bleak House and delivers an absurdly stilted, legalistic marriage proposal, speaking to Esther as if he's presenting a legal case. He declares his devotion in the most artificial, pompous language imaginable, clearly believing he's being romantic and impressive. He also mentions (indirectly) his investigations into Esther's parentage, suggesting he knows things about her background.

Esther gently but firmly rejects him. She's not unkind, but she makes it absolutely clear that she doesn't love him and will never marry him. Guppy is hurt and embarrassed, though he tries to maintain his dignity. He asks that they never mention this proposal again, and Esther agrees. The scene is both comic (Guppy's ridiculous manner) and touching (Esther's kind firmness).

The chapter also shows Richard's continuing deterioration. He's now in the army, having purchased a commission, but his obsession with the Jarndyce lawsuit continues to grow. He comes to visit Bleak House less frequently, and when he does, he's preoccupied and distant. His relationship with Mr. Jarndyce is increasingly strained. Richard has begun to suspect that Jarndyce isn't truly looking out for his interests in the lawsuit, that perhaps Jarndyce is even working against him. These suspicions are completely unfounded—Jarndyce wants nothing to do with the lawsuit and has only tried to protect Richard from it—but Richard's growing paranoia can't see this.

Ada is deeply worried about Richard but remains devoted to him. Esther sees her dear friend being drawn into Richard's destructive obsession and fears for both of them. The lawsuit is beginning to dominate Richard's entire existence, exactly as Mr. Jarndyce warned it would. Richard is following the same path as the countless other ruined suitors, unable to escape the case's gravitational pull despite all warnings and examples of destruction around him.
