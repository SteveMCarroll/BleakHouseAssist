Chapter 60: Perspective

The Jarndyce and Jarndyce case finally reaches its conclusion in Chancery Court. After decades of litigation, after destroying countless lives and consuming entire fortunes, the case is resolved. But the ending is hollow and devastating: the entire estate has been consumed by legal costs. There is nothing left. All the money that the various parties were fighting over has been eaten up by lawyers' fees, court costs, and the endless machinery of Chancery.

Richard, who has wasted his health, relationships, and resources pursuing the case, is completely devastated by this outcome. All his expectations, all his obsession, all his hopes have been for nothing. The case that was going to make his fortune has ended with nothing for anyone. Every penny of the disputed estate has gone to lawyers and the court system. The suitors get nothing.

Miss Flite witnesses the end of the case she's followed for so many years. She releases her caged birds—Hope, Joy, Youth, Life, and the others—symbolizing that the long wait is over, though not in the way anyone hoped. The birds fly free, but what freedom means after such long captivity is unclear.

The chapter's title "Perspective" suggests seeing the case clearly at last: it was all meaningless, all destructive, all for nothing. The Jarndyce and Jarndyce lawsuit, which has dominated so many lives and driven the novel's plot, ends with the ultimate irony—there's no inheritance, no fortune, nothing to show for all the suffering except legal bills. The system has consumed everything, exactly as Jarndyce warned it would. Richard and all the other suitors pursued a phantom, wasted their lives chasing something that was already gone.
