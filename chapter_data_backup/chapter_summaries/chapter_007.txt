Chapter 7: The Ghost's Walk

The narrative returns to Chesney Wold, where visitors have come to stay with the Dedlocks. Mrs. Rouncewell, the housekeeper who has served the family for fifty years, shows visitors around the estate and tells them the legend of the Ghost's Walk—the terrace where ghostly footsteps are heard before misfortune befalls the Dedlock family.

The legend concerns an angry Dedlock wife from generations past who, when her husband took the King's side in a civil war against her wishes, cursed the family. Having been injured (possibly deliberately by a horse) so that she walked with a halting step, she declared that her echo would walk the terrace until "the pride of this house is humbled." The ghostly footsteps are said to be heard before family disgrace or disaster. Mrs. Rouncewell insists the phenomenon is real—she has heard the steps herself.

This chapter serves primarily to reinforce the foreshadowing of coming disaster for the Dedlocks. The Ghost's Walk legend hangs over the family like a curse, creating an atmosphere of doom. Lady Dedlock's secret from her past is the hidden disgrace that will eventually humble the family's pride. The chapter also establishes Mrs. Rouncewell's character as a devoted, traditional servant and introduces her family: she has two sons, one of whom became a successful ironmaster (representing the rising industrial middle class).

The leisurely pace of aristocratic life at Chesney Wold contrasts sharply with the desperate struggles in London. Sir Leicester's world of tradition, precedent, and aristocratic pride is presented as increasingly anachronistic—a world that's passing away. The Ghost's Walk legend suggests that this proud world is heading toward its doom, and Lady Dedlock's secret will be the agent of that downfall.
