Chapter 38: A Struggle

Esther visits Ada and discovers a secret that Ada has been keeping: Ada has married Richard. Despite Richard's deteriorating condition, despite Jarndyce's disapproval, despite all the warnings about Richard's instability and obsession, Ada has married him out of love and loyalty. The marriage was conducted quietly, without announcement or celebration.

Ada's decision is both admirable and heartbreaking. She knows Richard is being destroyed by the lawsuit, knows he's unstable and obsessed, but she loves him and wants to stand by him. She believes he needs her support now more than ever. Ada has chosen to bind her fate to Richard's, for better or worse. She'll be with him through his ruin, sharing whatever consequences come from his obsession.

Esther is deeply moved and troubled by this revelation. She understands Ada's love and loyalty, but she fears for her friend's future. Ada is now tied to Richard's destructive path. Whatever happens to Richard—financial ruin, mental breakdown, physical collapse—will affect Ada too. It's a selfless act of love but also potentially a shared tragedy.

The marriage represents Ada's complete commitment despite knowing the likely outcome. Unlike those who marry with hope and optimism, Ada marries Richard with full knowledge of his problems and flaws. She's not deluded about his condition—she sees clearly that the lawsuit is destroying him—but she chooses to stay with him anyway. The chapter's title "A Struggle" refers both to Ada's internal struggle about this decision and to the struggle Ada and Richard will now face together as Richard continues his downward spiral. The chapter is bittersweet—true love and loyalty existing alongside inevitable tragedy.
