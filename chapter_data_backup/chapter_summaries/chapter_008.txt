Chapter 8: Covering a Multitude of Sins

Mr. Tulkinghorn, determined to discover whose handwriting affected Lady Dedlock so powerfully, begins his investigation. He visits Mr. Snagsby, a law stationer who supplied the document, to learn who copied it. Snagsby is a mild, harmless man married to a suspicious, jealous wife. He reveals that the copyist was a law-writer named Nemo who lives in a squalid room above the shop of Krook, a rag-and-bottle dealer.

Krook is introduced as a grotesque character, nicknamed "the Lord Chancellor" because he hoards documents and papers, creating his own chaotic archive. His shop is filled with papers, rags, bottles, and waste, representing another kind of accumulation and disorder—a low-life mirror of Chancery's documentary chaos. Krook is illiterate but collects written material obsessively.

Tulkinghorn visits Nemo's miserable lodging—a bare, cold room that reeks of poverty and opium. Nemo himself is a mysterious figure: "Nemo" means "no one" in Latin, suggesting he has deliberately erased his identity. Tulkinghorn finds him in a state of degradation, surrounded by evidence of opium use. Nemo does copying work for a pittance, living in complete obscurity and apparent despair.

The chapter also introduces Miss Flite (seen briefly in Chapter 1), a little mad woman who lives in Krook's building and attends Chancery court faithfully every day, waiting for judgment in her favor. She keeps caged birds with allegorical names like Hope, Joy, Youth, Peace, and Life, saying she will release them when her judgment comes—which of course it never will. She represents the victims of Chancery driven to madness by endless waiting.

The investigation is drawing Tulkinghorn closer to Lady Dedlock's secret, though he doesn't yet understand what it is. The chapter's title refers to charity covering sins, but also suggests how society hides and ignores the desperate poverty and degradation represented by Nemo and the world around Krook's shop.
