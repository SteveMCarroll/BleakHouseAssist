Chapter 63: Steel and Iron

This chapter brings closure to the Rouncewell family story and shows the continuing decline at Chesney Wold. The title refers to the Rouncewell family business—they represent the new industrial England of steel and iron manufacturing, a force of modernity and progress. Mr. Rouncewell, the successful ironmaster, visits Chesney Wold to see his brother George and his mother Mrs. Rouncewell. The reunion of the family is warm but also highlights the different paths the brothers have taken. Mr. Rouncewell has become prosperous and influential through industry and enterprise, while George remained a wandering soldier until finding his place serving Sir Leicester.

Sir Leicester receives the Rouncewells with courtesy despite his weakened condition. The contrast between the old aristocratic world and the new industrial power is evident but handled with mutual respect. Mr. Rouncewell represents the rising middle class that is reshaping England—practical, hardworking, and increasingly wealthy and powerful. Sir Leicester represents the old landed aristocracy, still dignified but clearly in decline. The industrial revolution is changing the social order, but Dickens shows both worlds with sympathy. Neither the old aristocracy nor the new industrialists are entirely good or bad; they are simply different systems adapting to changing times.

The chapter also continues to show life at Chesney Wold adjusting to its reduced circumstances. The great house functions but lacks its former vitality. Mrs. Rouncewell maintains the household with her usual competence, but everyone understands that an era is ending. Lady Dedlock's absence is felt everywhere. Sir Leicester, though unable to move freely or speak clearly, remains the master of Chesney Wold, preserving what he can of the old ways. George's presence provides practical help and companionship. The Dedlock legacy will continue in diminished form, tended by faithful servants and a paralyzed baronet who refuses to abandon his responsibilities despite his losses.
