Chapter 15: Bell Yard

Esther and Mr. Jarndyce learn that Neckett, a bailiff (or "follower" as he was called—someone who pursues debtors), has died suddenly, leaving three young orphaned children. They go to investigate and find the eldest child, Charlotte (called Charley), age thirteen, caring heroically for her two younger siblings in terrible poverty. Charley is washing clothes and doing whatever work she can find to support her brother Tom and baby sister Emma. Despite their desperate circumstances, Charley shows remarkable courage, competence, and love for her siblings.

The children live in the same building as Krook's shop and Miss Flite. Miss Flite has been helping the children as best she can with her limited resources. When Esther and Jarndyce arrive, they find Charley struggling but determined to keep the family together. The baby is sick, and the children have almost nothing to eat or wear.

Mr. Jarndyce immediately arranges practical help—he'll ensure the children are properly cared for and that Charley will eventually come to Bleak House as Esther's maid once her siblings are settled. This is Jarndyce's practical charity in action: no grand schemes or speeches, just immediate, effective assistance to people in desperate need. Esther is deeply moved by Charley's devotion to her siblings and by the girl's dignity in the face of hardship.

The chapter contrasts sharply with the earlier portraits of false charity (Mrs. Jellyby, Mrs. Pardiggle). Jarndyce's help is quiet, practical, and respectful of the recipients' dignity. Charley's character also represents one of Dickens's recurring themes: the strength and goodness found among the poor who help each other survive. The chapter shows real charity and real need, without sentimentality but with genuine compassion.
