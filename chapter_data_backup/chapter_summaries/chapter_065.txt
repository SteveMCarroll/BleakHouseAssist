Chapter 65: Beginning the World

Richard Carstone dies, reconciled at the last with Mr. Jarndyce and finally free from the obsession that consumed him. His final moments bring a kind of peace—he acknowledges Jarndyce's goodness, accepts that the lawsuit was a destructive delusion, and entrusts Ada and their unborn child to Jarndyce's care. The title "Beginning the World" is bitterly ironic for Richard, who dies just as he might have begun to rebuild his life with clarity and wisdom. But it applies hopefully to others: Ada must begin the world anew as a young widow and mother, and Esther and Woodcourt are literally beginning their married life together. Richard's death, while tragic, finally closes the Jarndyce and Jarndyce chapter for the survivors.

Ada is devastated by Richard's death but not broken. She has the strength of character that Richard lacked, the ability to face reality without illusions. She is pregnant with Richard's child, which gives her both grief and purpose—a living connection to the husband she loved despite his flaws. Mr. Jarndyce immediately makes clear that Ada and her baby will be cared for. He takes Ada back into his household, providing the security and support she needs. This is Jarndyce at his best again—practical, generous, asking nothing in return, simply doing what needs to be done for those who need help. Ada will raise Richard's child in safety, away from the corruption that destroyed its father.

The chapter emphasizes themes of renewal and moving forward. Richard's death, while sad, also represents an ending to the poison of Jarndyce and Jarndyce. Those who survive can now live free from the lawsuit's shadow. Esther and Woodcourt have their marriage and will build a life together based on love and useful work—Woodcourt as a physician helping the poor, Esther as his partner and helpmate. Ada will raise her child with love and the support of Jarndyce's protection. Even in tragedy, there is hope for new beginnings. The survivors carry lessons learned from the past but are not imprisoned by it. They can begin the world again, wiser and more grateful for genuine human connections rather than legal fantasies.
