Chapter 64: Esther's Narrative

Esther narrates her wedding day to Allan Woodcourt, the moment she has hoped for but hardly dared to believe would come. Mr. Jarndyce has arranged everything with his characteristic thoughtfulness and generosity. The wedding is quiet and intimate, reflecting Esther's modest nature rather than any grand social display. Esther reflects on her journey—from the lonely, unloved child who was told she should never have been born, to a woman loved and valued by good people. Her marriage to Woodcourt represents not just romantic fulfillment but validation that she deserves happiness and love. Jarndyce gives her away with genuine joy in her happiness, having orchestrated everything so she could marry the man she truly loves.

However, the joy of Esther's wedding day is shadowed by Richard's rapidly declining condition. Even as Esther celebrates her new beginning, Richard is approaching his end. Woodcourt, as both friend and physician, is deeply concerned about Richard's failing health. They visit Richard and Ada, finding Richard bedridden and clearly very weak. The contrast between the two couples is stark and poignant—Esther and Woodcourt beginning their life together with hope and good prospects, while Richard and Ada face tragedy despite their mutual love. Ada is pregnant but will likely become a widow and single mother. Richard's obsession with Jarndyce and Jarndyce has cost him everything, including his life.

Richard's dying moments become a scene of reconciliation. Mr. Jarndyce comes to Richard's bedside, and Richard finally understands what he refused to see before—that Jarndyce was always trying to help him, not harm him. The paranoia and suspicion that the lawsuit bred in Richard's mind dissolves as death approaches, and he sees clearly at last that his true enemy was never Jarndyce but the corrupting legal system itself. He thanks Jarndyce and asks his forgiveness for doubting him. Ada, surrounded by those who love her, faces the devastating loss of her husband. Richard dies young, destroyed by Chancery, another victim of a system that promised justice but delivered only destruction. His death serves as the novel's final, tragic proof of the lawsuit's human cost.
