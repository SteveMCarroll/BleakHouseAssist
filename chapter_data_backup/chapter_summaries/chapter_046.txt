Chapter 46: Stop Him!

The dramatic climax of the murder investigation: Mr. Bucket reveals the true murderer. It's Mademoiselle Hortense, Lady Dedlock's former French maid. Hortense killed Tulkinghorn out of revenge. She had been dismissed from Lady Dedlock's service and felt wronged. She blamed Tulkinghorn for her misfortunes and decided to kill him. Her motive was personal vengeance rather than any connection to Lady Dedlock's secret.

Bucket's revelation is dramatic and carefully orchestrated. He has been watching Hortense all along, gathering evidence, and waiting for the right moment to make his arrest. When he finally moves to arrest her, she's fierce and unrepentant, showing her passionate, violent nature. She doesn't regret the murder—she feels Tulkinghorn deserved to die for the wrongs she believes he did to her.

Mr. George is released, exonerated of the murder charge. His mother Mrs. Rouncewell and his brother are relieved and grateful. George's honor has been vindicated—he was innocent all along, just as he claimed. The arrest of the real murderer clears George's name and allows him to return to his life, though the experience has been traumatic.

The chapter's title "Stop Him!" comes from the moment of arrest and the drama of catching the murderer. Hortense's arrest is violent and dramatic—she resists and must be forcibly detained. The solution to the murder mystery is satisfying in its logic: Bucket has followed the evidence methodically and correctly identified the killer. But the murder's solution doesn't resolve all the novel's problems—Lady Dedlock's secret is still exposed, and she's still fled in despair. The murder investigation is concluded, but the tragedy of the Dedlocks continues to unfold.
