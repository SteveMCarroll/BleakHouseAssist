Chapter 10: The Law-Writer

The narrative returns to London and the world around Krook's shop. Nemo, the mysterious law-writer, is found dead in his miserable room, apparently from an opium overdose. A doctor is called—Allan Woodcourt, a young surgeon who will become important later. An inquest is held to determine the cause of death. The proceeding is perfunctory; Nemo's death is deemed an accidental overdose, and no one seems to care much about the death of this unknown, friendless man.

The only person who shows genuine grief is Jo, a young crossing-sweeper (a street child who sweeps crossings for pennies). Jo is nearly illiterate, poor, homeless, and completely alone in the world—even more destitute than Nemo was. Jo testifies that Nemo was kind to him, the only person who ever was. This tiny act of kindness from a dying man to a desperate boy provides the only human warmth in the otherwise cold proceeding.

After the inquest, Jo encounters a mysterious veiled lady dressed in black who asks him to show her where Nemo lived and where he is buried. She gives Jo a generous sovereign and asks many questions about Nemo, clearly deeply moved and distressed. Jo takes her to the horrible pauper's burial ground where Nemo has been interred—a ghastly place of disease, overcrowding, and disrespect for the dead. The lady is obviously devastated but keeps her veil down and doesn't reveal her identity.

The reader understands (though Jo doesn't) that this veiled lady is Lady Dedlock. The handwriting that affected her so strongly was Nemo's—he was clearly someone from her past, someone she loved. His death and pauper's burial fill her with anguish. Her secret past is becoming clearer: she and Nemo had some intimate connection before her marriage to Sir Leicester. Mr. Tulkinghorn and Mr. Snagsby observe from a distance, and Tulkinghorn now knows that Lady Dedlock is somehow connected to the dead law-writer.

The chapter powerfully depicts the contrast between rich and poor, the indifference of society to suffering, and the particular horror of pauper burials in overcrowded urban graveyards—a social evil Dickens campaigned against. Jo's character embodies innocence and suffering, while Nemo's lonely death represents the fate of those whom society has discarded.
