Chapter 5: A Morning Adventure

The three young wards leave London for Bleak House in Hertfordshire, their new home. During the journey, they encounter Harold Skimpole, a charming middle-aged man who claims to be a complete child when it comes to practical matters, especially money. Skimpole presents himself as an innocent who knows nothing of worldly affairs and takes no responsibility for debts or obligations. He has been arrested for a small debt and is being taken to a sponging-house (a preliminary detention before debtors' prison).

Richard, moved by Skimpole's apparent helplessness and charming conversation, impulsively pays the debt to free him. Skimpole accepts this generosity with airiness, as if it's the most natural thing in the world, showing no real gratitude or awareness that Richard might not be able to afford such generosity. This introduction establishes Skimpole as a dangerous character—someone whose charm and professed innocence mask actual selfishness and parasitism.

The young people arrive at Bleak House and meet their guardian, John Jarndyce, for the first time. He is immediately revealed as a kind, generous, and thoughtful man who has prepared a warm welcome. The house itself, despite its gloomy name, is actually comfortable and cheerful. Mr. Jarndyce gives Esther a special role: he appoints her the housekeeper, giving her a basket of keys and real responsibilities. For Esther, who has never had a home or real purpose, this is profoundly moving—she has a place, a role, and a family.

The chapter introduces Jarndyce's peculiarity: whenever the Jarndyce and Jarndyce lawsuit is mentioned, he talks about "the wind being in the east" and becomes uncomfortable, changing the subject. This becomes his way of avoiding discussion of the case that has caused his family so much misery. The chapter establishes Bleak House as a place of warmth and kindness, in stark contrast to the cold institutional worlds of Chancery and Chesney Wold.
