Chapter 3: A Progress

This chapter introduces Esther Summerson, who will be one of the novel's two narrators. She tells the story of her loveless childhood in her characteristic modest, self-deprecating voice (constantly insisting she is "not clever"). Esther was raised by her godmother, Miss Barbary, a strict, cold woman who never smiled and repeatedly told Esther it would have been better if she had never been born. Esther was made to understand that her very existence was shameful, that her birth was connected to sin, and that she must pray for forgiveness for the circumstances that brought her into the world.

The only affection in Esther's childhood came from her doll, to whom she confided all her secrets. Mrs. Rachael, Miss Barbary's servant, was also austere toward Esther. Esther attended a boarding school as a day student but was never invited to other girls' homes and never went out socially. Her birthday was always the most melancholy day of the year.

The chapter's emotional climax comes on Esther's birthday when Miss Barbary tells her coldly: "Your mother, Esther, is your disgrace, and you were hers." This devastating revelation—that Esther's mother is alive, that Esther is the product of some shameful circumstance—deeply wounds the young girl. Miss Barbary says she has forgiven Esther's mother "the wrong she did to me," suggesting some personal betrayal beyond mere moral disapproval.

After Miss Barbary's sudden death, Esther spends six more years at school under the care of the kindly principal Miss Donny. Then Mr. Kenge, a lawyer known as "Conversation Kenge" for his elaborate speeches, arrives to tell Esther that she has been provided for by an anonymous benefactor. She is to become a companion to the daughter of a gentleman. Though Esther doesn't yet know it, this benefactor is John Jarndyce, and she is about to begin her journey to Bleak House. The chapter establishes Esther's character—her goodness, her damaged self-worth, and the mystery surrounding her birth that will be central to the novel's plot.
