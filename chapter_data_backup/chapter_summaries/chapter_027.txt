Chapter 27: More Old Soldiers Than One

Mr. George visits Chesney Wold and is reunited with his mother, Mrs. Rouncewell, the housekeeper. This is an emotional reunion—George has been estranged from his family for many years, living independently and refusing family help. Mrs. Rouncewell is overjoyed to see her son again but worried about his circumstances. She can see he's in some kind of trouble, though George tries to hide it from her.

George's brother is also visiting—Mr. Rouncewell the ironmaster, who has become a very successful businessman. The contrast between the two brothers is striking: one represents the old military values (George), the other represents the new industrial wealth and middle-class power (Rouncewell). The ironmaster has money and influence, while George has struggled in poverty, but George has maintained his independence and self-respect while living according to his own principles.

Mrs. Rouncewell tries to get George to accept help from his wealthy brother, but George is too proud. He doesn't want charity, even from family. This pride and independence are both admirable and self-defeating—George is in real financial trouble with Smallweed's debt, but he won't ask for help. The reunion shows the warmth between mother and son despite years of separation, and also shows George's stubborn adherence to his own code of honor.

The visit to Chesney Wold connects George to the world of the Dedlocks. His mother has served them faithfully for fifty years, and George himself is drawn into the orbit of their affairs through Tulkinghorn's investigation and his possession of Captain Hawdon's letters. The chapter shows George as another fundamentally good person being caught up in the complex web of secrets and investigations surrounding Lady Dedlock's past. It also emphasizes the theme of social change—the old aristocratic world (Chesney Wold), the military honor of the past (George), and the rising industrial power (the ironmaster brother) all meeting and adjusting to new realities.
