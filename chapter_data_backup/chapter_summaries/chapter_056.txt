Chapter 56: Pursuit

The desperate chase for Lady Dedlock reaches its climax. Bucket and Esther are on her trail, getting closer with each passing moment. They've figured out where she's heading—to the cemetery where Nemo is buried. The pursuit is a race against time, with everyone aware that Lady Dedlock has been out in the cold too long and is in a dangerous state of physical and mental exhaustion.

Bucket pushes forward relentlessly, using all his skills to track Lady Dedlock's movements through London. Esther is desperate, exhausted but driven by her need to reach her mother and tell her she's forgiven, that Sir Leicester loves her and wants her home. The chapter conveys the urgency and intensity of the search.

They follow Lady Dedlock's path through various locations, always just behind her. Witnesses report seeing a woman in ragged clothes moving toward the cemetery. The searchers know they're close but also that every moment matters. Lady Dedlock's condition must be deteriorating—she's been walking all night in the cold, dressed inadequately, without rest or food.

The pursuit is both physical (chasing through London streets) and emotional (trying to reach Lady Dedlock before tragedy strikes). Bucket's professional skills and Esther's personal desperation combine in this final chase. The chapter maintains intense suspense as they close in on Lady Dedlock's location, knowing that they're either in time or too late.
