Chapter 21: The Smallweed Family

This chapter provides a full portrait of the grotesque Smallweed family. Grandfather Smallweed is an elderly money-lender, completely mercenary and grasping. He's physically decrepit but mentally sharp when it comes to money and exploitation. Grandmother Smallweed is an invalid who can barely speak coherently, sitting in a chair and occasionally being "shaken up" by family members when she slumps over. The two grandchildren living with them, Bart (also called Small) and Judy, are joyless young people who have been raised without any

 childhood, educated only in money-making and calculation.

The Smallweed household is completely loveless and devoid of warmth or humanity. There are no books except account books, no games or entertainment, no affection or family feeling—only the endless pursuit of money through usury and exploitation. The family represents a kind of moral death: they're technically alive but utterly without human feeling or joy. Dickens presents them as examples of what happens when the pursuit of money becomes the sole purpose of existence.

The chapter reveals that the Smallweeds are holding certain papers and documents related to Captain Hawdon (Nemo). Through various schemes and calculations, they've come into possession of materials that could be valuable—either for blackmail or to sell to interested parties like Mr. Tulkinghorn. They're planning how to extract maximum profit from these papers.

Grandfather Smallweed is putting increasing pressure on Mr. George over his debt, seeing George's financial difficulties as an opportunity for exploitation. The Smallweeds represent predatory lending at its worst, squeezing money from people in difficulty. The chapter shows the dark underside of Victorian capitalism: families like the Smallweeds who produce nothing, help no one, but grow rich by lending money at exorbitant rates and foreclosing on debts. They're one of Dickens's most unpleasant creations—comic in their grotesqueness but terrifying in their complete lack of humanity.
