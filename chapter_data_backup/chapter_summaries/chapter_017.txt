Chapter 17: Esther's Narrative

Esther narrates again, and significant time has passed. Charley has now become Esther's maid and is devoted to her, grateful for the opportunity Mr. Jarndyce has given her. Charley's siblings are being cared for, and she's learning and growing in her new role. The relationship between Esther and Charley is warm and affectionate—more like sisters than mistress and servant.

Richard has given up the law just as quickly as he gave up medicine. Now he wants to join the army and buy a commission as an officer. This latest career change deeply worries Mr. Jarndyce, who sees Richard becoming increasingly unstable and unfocused. More troubling still, Richard is becoming obsessed with the Jarndyce and Jarndyce lawsuit. He talks constantly about his "expectations" from the case and has started to believe that Mr. Jarndyce is somehow keeping information from him or not pursuing the case vigorously enough.

The relationship between Richard and Mr. Jarndyce is starting to fray. Richard's growing suspicion and preoccupation with the lawsuit creates tension. Jarndyce has warned Richard repeatedly about the dangers of the case, but Richard can't help being drawn to it. He sees it as his path to fortune and independence. The "east wind" that Jarndyce always mentions—his metaphor for the corrupting influence of Chancery—is blowing more strongly now.

Ada and Richard's romantic attachment is deepening, but this worries Mr. Jarndyce, who fears that Richard's instability and lawsuit-obsession make him an unsuitable match for Ada. Esther finds herself in the difficult position of loving both Ada and Richard while seeing Richard's deterioration. The chapter shows the lawsuit beginning to destroy Richard, just as it has destroyed so many others. Despite being warned, despite seeing examples of ruin all around him, Richard cannot resist the siren call of his "expectations."
