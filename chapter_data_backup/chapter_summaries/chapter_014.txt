Chapter 14: Deportment

Caddy Jellyby visits Esther at Bleak House with surprising news: she's engaged to be married! Her fiancé is Prince Turveydrop, a gentle young man who teaches dancing. Caddy and Esther visit Prince at his dancing academy to meet his father, old Mr. Turveydrop, who proves to be one of Dickens's most absurd comic characters.

Old Mr. Turveydrop is a vain, pompous man obsessed with "Deportment"—the art of elegant bearing and manners. He believes himself to be a model of refinement and grace, a living example of the old school of gentlemanly elegance. In reality, he's a ridiculous parasite who lives entirely off his son's labor. Prince works exhaustingly hard teaching dancing to support both himself and his demanding father, while old Turveydrop does nothing but pose and preen, believing his mere "Deportment" is his contribution to the world.

The chapter satirizes vanity, selfishness, and the abuse of parental authority. Old Turveydrop has convinced his gentle son that supporting his father's idleness is a sacred duty, and Prince accepts this burden without complaint. When Caddy announces the engagement, old Turveydrop graciously "blesses" the union—on the condition that Caddy will help support him and that he will continue to live with the young couple. He presents this as magnanimous generosity on his part.

Esther supports Caddy's engagement wholeheartedly. She sees that Prince is genuinely good and gentle, if oppressed by his absurd father, and that Caddy loves him. The chapter shows Caddy escaping one form of parental exploitation (her mother's) only to enter another (her future father-in-law's), but at least she'll be with someone she loves and can build her own household. The portrait of old Turveydrop exemplifies Dickens's genius for creating memorable comic grotesques who embody real social evils—in this case, parasitic self-regard masked as refined breeding.
