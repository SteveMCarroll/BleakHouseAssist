Chapter 39: Attorney and Client

A shocking, dramatic event occurs: Mr. Tulkinghorn has been murdered! He's found shot through the heart in his chambers. The murder scene is discovered, and immediate investigation begins. This is the novel's central crime—the man who held so many secrets, who had power over so many people, has been killed.

Mr. George, the ex-soldier, becomes the prime suspect and is arrested for the murder. The evidence appears damning: George had motive (Tulkinghorn was pressuring him about Captain Hawdon's letters and about his debts), George had opportunity (he was seen in the area), and George owns firearms and knows how to use them. The circumstantial case against him seems strong.

Mr. Bucket leads the murder investigation, methodically examining the scene and questioning witnesses. Grandfather Smallweed immediately moves to take possession of George's shooting gallery, seeing an opportunity to profit from George's misfortune. With George arrested and facing murder charges, Smallweed can claim the property for the debt.

The chapter is dramatic and shocking—Tulkinghorn, who has been such a powerful, threatening presence throughout the novel, is suddenly gone, murdered in his own chambers. The murder creates new complications and mysteries: Who actually killed Tulkinghorn? What will happen to the secrets he held? How will his death affect Lady Dedlock, who lived under his power? And will the innocent Mr. George be convicted of a murder he didn't commit? The investigation will now dominate the narrative, with various characters falling under suspicion. Tulkinghorn's death doesn't resolve the tensions he created—if anything, it makes them more acute and dangerous.
