Chapter 40: National and Domestic

News of Tulkinghorn's murder reaches Chesney Wold, shocking everyone. Sir Leicester is deeply affected—Tulkinghorn was not just his lawyer but his trusted advisor for decades, keeper of family secrets, a figure of reliability and discretion. The murder of such a respectable, established figure is almost incomprehensible to Sir Leicester. He's distressed both personally and by what it represents—violence intruding into his ordered, civilized world.

Lady Dedlock's reaction is more complex. Tulkinghorn's death should be a relief—the man who held her secret and had power over her is gone. But his murder actually makes her situation worse. She becomes an obvious suspect, having the strongest possible motive: Tulkinghorn knew her secret and could have destroyed her. Everyone who knows about the investigation will naturally think of Lady Dedlock as a suspect.

Mr. Bucket arrives at Chesney Wold to investigate. His presence creates tension and unease in the household. He questions various people, observes reactions, and begins piecing together Tulkinghorn's activities and relationships. Bucket is methodical and thorough, missing nothing. His investigation will inevitably uncover Lady Dedlock's secret even if she's not the murderer.

The chapter's title "National and Domestic" refers to the dual levels of the narrative—the personal/domestic tragedy of the Dedlocks alongside broader themes about English society. The murder investigation brings together the aristocratic world of Chesney Wold, the legal world of London, and various other social spheres. The chapter shows how Tulkinghorn's death has consequences rippling through multiple levels of society, from the highest (the Dedlocks) to various other characters whose lives intersected with the murdered lawyer. The investigation will force many hidden things into the light.
