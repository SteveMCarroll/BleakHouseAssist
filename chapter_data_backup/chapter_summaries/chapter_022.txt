Chapter 22: Mr. Bucket

This chapter focuses on Mr. Bucket, the detective, as he continues his various investigations. Bucket is shown moving through different levels of London society with equal ease—from fashionable drawing rooms to the worst slums. He has informants everywhere and seems to know everything that happens in London. His methods are methodical and relentless; once he's pursuing something, he never gives up.

Jo, the crossing-sweeper, is still sick and being constantly moved on. He's getting weaker and more desperate. The various investigations surrounding him—Tulkinghorn's inquiry into Lady Dedlock's past, Mrs. Snagsby's jealous imaginings, Bucket's detective work—swirl around the sick, frightened boy who understands nothing of what's happening. Jo is caught up in affairs completely beyond his comprehension.

Mr. Snagsby continues to help Jo secretly out of compassion, giving him money when he can. But Mrs. Snagsby's jealousy has reached paranoid levels. She follows her husband, spies on him, and has convinced herself that there's some terrible secret connection between Snagsby and Jo. Her imagination runs wild with baseless accusations. The innocent Snagsby finds himself suspected of all sorts of wrongdoing simply because he's shown kindness to a desperate child.

The chapter shows Bucket's skill as an investigator—his ability to gather information, his understanding of human nature, his patience in pursuing leads. But it also shows the human cost of these investigations. Jo is sick and hunted, Snagsby is tormented by his wife's unfounded suspicions, and various innocent people are being drawn into affairs that will hurt them. The machinery of investigation grinds on, unconcerned with the suffering it causes to those caught in its gears. Lady Dedlock's secret is being exposed piece by piece, but the process is destroying lives along the way.
