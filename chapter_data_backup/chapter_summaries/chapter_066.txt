Chapter 66: Down in Lincolnshire

This chapter returns to Chesney Wold and paints a melancholy picture of the great estate in decline. The once-grand house continues to function but has lost its heart and vitality. Sir Leicester Dedlock remains, paralyzed and weakened, a solitary figure haunting the halls where his wife once presided. The seasonal rains fall on the estate as they did at the novel's beginning, but now the mood is autumnal and elegiac rather than merely gloomy. The Dedlock family, once so prominent and powerful, is fading into history. Without an heir and without Lady Dedlock, Chesney Wold has become more monument than home, a relic of aristocratic England's past.

Sir Leicester maintains his dignity and his daily routines as best he can, supported by George Rouncewell and the faithful Mrs. Rouncewell. He keeps Lady Dedlock's rooms exactly as she left them, a shrine to his lost wife. His forgiveness of her was complete and genuine—he loved her despite everything and mourns her without bitterness or recrimination. The paralyzed baronet represents a kind of nobility in his constancy and grace under suffering. He has lost everything that mattered to him—his wife, his health, his family's future—yet he maintains his principles and his honor. Visitors are rare now, and the social world that once revolved around Chesney Wold has moved on.

The chapter emphasizes the passage of time and the inevitability of change. The old aristocratic order is dying with Sir Leicester, literally and symbolically. The great house will likely pass to distant relatives who lack connection to its history and traditions. The rain that falls on Chesney Wold seems to wash away the past, eroding the foundations of the old world. Yet there is dignity in the decline—Sir Leicester faces the end of his world with grace, the faithful servants maintain their duties, and the house itself stands as a monument to what once was. Dickens shows sympathy for the passing of this world even as he acknowledges that its time has gone and a new, more democratic and industrial England is rising.
