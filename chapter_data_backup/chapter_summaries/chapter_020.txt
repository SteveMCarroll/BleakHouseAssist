Chapter 20: A New Lodger

This chapter introduces Mr. George, a tall, upright ex-soldier who runs a shooting gallery in London. George is a man of honor and principle, living a simple life teaching firearms and fencing to young men. He's assisted by Phil Squod, a disabled man who helps maintain the gallery. The shooting gallery becomes a refuge for various characters and represents a kind of working-class honor and independence.

Mr. George is being pressured by Grandfather Smallweed, a money-lender, over an old debt. Smallweed is beginning a campaign of financial harassment, demanding payment and threatening legal action. George is struggling financially but maintains his dignity and refuses to be intimidated, though the debt worries him.

Mr. Tulkinghorn visits George's shooting gallery, seeking information. Tulkinghorn wants certain letters—letters written by Captain Hawdon (which was Nemo's real name before he became a destitute law-writer). These letters are relevant to Tulkinghorn's investigation of Lady Dedlock's past. George knew Captain Hawdon in the army and may have some of his letters, but George refuses to give them up out of loyalty to his dead comrade. Even under pressure and in financial difficulty, George won't betray a friend's memory.

The chapter establishes George as another of Dickens's admirable characters—a man of the working class who lives by a code of honor. Unlike Skimpole who pretends to be above worldly concerns while parasitizing others, George faces his debts and obligations honestly. Unlike the calculating Tulkinghorn or the grasping Smallweed, George values loyalty and principle above financial advantage. The chapter also hints at George's background—there are suggestions he comes from a respectable family he's been estranged from. The mystery of his past and his connection to Captain Hawdon/Nemo links him to the novel's central plot concerning Lady Dedlock's secret.
