Chapter 26: Sharpshooters

The chapter focuses on Mr. George and his shooting gallery. Grandfather Smallweed is intensifying his pressure on George over the old debt, threatening legal action and foreclosure. George is struggling financially but maintains his honor and refuses to compromise his principles even under this pressure. The debt weighs on him, but he won't give up the letters from Captain Hawdon that Tulkinghorn wants—loyalty to his dead friend matters more than financial convenience.

Phil Squod, George's disabled assistant, is shown to be completely devoted to George. Phil's physical disabilities make him grotesque in appearance, but he's loyal, hardworking, and grateful to George for giving him employment and treating him with respect. Their relationship shows George's essential decency—he judges people by their character, not their appearance or social position.

Mr. Tulkinghorn continues to visit George, pressuring him to produce Captain Hawdon's letters. Tulkinghorn offers various inducements and veiled threats, but George remains firm. He knew Hawdon in the army and won't betray his memory by giving up personal letters, regardless of what it might cost him. George doesn't fully understand why these letters are so important or what investigation Tulkinghorn is pursuing, but his sense of honor won't allow him to cooperate.

The chapter establishes the shooting gallery as a kind of refuge—a working-class space where men can practice marksmanship and fencing, where honor and loyalty still mean something. It's a masculine world governed by codes of conduct and mutual respect. George represents a military ideal of honor that's increasingly at odds with the calculating, mercenary world represented by Smallweed and Tulkinghorn. He's another character being squeezed by forces beyond his control—caught between his debts and his principles, between Smallweed's financial pressure and Tulkinghorn's investigation, trying to maintain his integrity while his world collapses around him.
