Chapter 1: In Chancery

The chapter opens with one of literature's most famous atmospheric descriptions: London in November, shrouded in thick fog and deep mud. Dickens uses the fog as a powerful metaphor for the Court of Chancery, which sits at the heart of the fog in Lincoln's Inn Hall. The imagery is vivid and oppressive—fog everywhere, mud in the streets, dogs and horses indistinguishable in the mire, people slipping and sliding.

The Lord High Chancellor presides over the endless case of Jarndyce and Jarndyce, a lawsuit over a disputed will that has dragged on for generations. The case has become so complicated that no one alive understands what it means anymore. Innumerable people have been born, married, and died while the case continues. Tom Jarndyce, driven to despair by the lawsuit, shot himself at a coffee-house in Chancery Lane. The case has consumed entire fortunes in legal fees while lawyers have grown rich from it. Every master in Chancery has had a reference from it; it's become a joke in the legal profession, though it has been death to many.

The chapter introduces several characters from the courtroom: Miss Flite, a little mad old woman who always expects some incomprehensible judgment in her favor; a ruined prisoner who keeps trying to 'purge himself of contempt'; and another ruined suitor from Shropshire who periodically appears to address the Chancellor. The court scene ends with the Chancellor mentioning two young wards—Ada and Richard—who are to reside with a relative (later revealed to be their cousin John Jarndyce). The chapter powerfully establishes the theme of Chancery as a destructive force that corrupts and ruins everyone it touches, while lawyers profit from the misery of their clients.
