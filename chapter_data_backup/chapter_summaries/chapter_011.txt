Chapter 11: Our Dear Brother

This short but powerful chapter describes Nemo's burial. The pauper's funeral is conducted with the barest formalities at a ghastly overcrowded cemetery. The irony of the chapter's title—"Our Dear Brother"—contrasts sharply with the reality: no one genuinely cares about Nemo except Jo, the crossing-sweeper boy who stands watching from a distance. The clergyman mechanically recites the burial service, calling the deceased "our dear brother," but these are empty words—Nemo died friendless, unknown, and unmourned except by one street child.

The burial ground itself is a horror: overcrowded, disease-ridden, with bodies buried too close together and too shallow. Dickens uses this scene to expose the terrible conditions of urban pauper burial grounds, a social evil he campaigned against in real life. The dead are treated with no dignity or respect; they are simply disposed of as cheaply as possible.

Mr. Snagsby attends the funeral, troubled by the whole affair and by his involvement in it. His wife, Mrs. Snagsby, is becoming increasingly suspicious and jealous, imagining all sorts of wrongdoing on her husband's part, though he's completely innocent. The chapter serves as a powerful social critique: society pays lip service to Christian brotherhood ("our dear brother") while treating its poorest members, in life and death, with callous indifference. Jo, standing alone and grieving, represents true human feeling in contrast to the hollow ceremonies of respectable society.
