Chapter 47: Jo's Will

This is one of the novel's most emotionally powerful and heartbreaking chapters. Jo, the homeless crossing-sweeper who has been sick throughout much of the novel, is dying. He's at Mr. George's shooting gallery, where he's been given refuge. Allan Woodcourt, the young doctor who has cared for the poor throughout the novel, is treating Jo, but there's nothing more he can do—Jo is too weak and has been sick too long.

Esther comes to be with Jo in his final moments. Despite her own troubles (learning about her mother, facing her approaching marriage), she takes time to comfort this dying child. Jo recognizes her kindly face, though he's confused and feverish. The scene is incredibly tender—Esther offering comfort to someone who has had almost no kindness in his entire life.

Jo dies unable to say the Lord's Prayer properly because he was never taught it. Allan Woodcourt tries to help him say it, but Jo can only manage fragments, mixing up the words because he never learned them. His last words are variations on "move on"—the phrase that has defined his existence. Jo dies as he lived, unwanted and moved along, a victim of society's indifference.

The chapter is Dickens's most powerful indictment of social neglect. Jo's death symbolizes the fate of the poor and helpless in Victorian society—used, exploited, moved along, and ultimately abandoned to die. Jo was innocent and kind, mourned Nemo when no one else did, and asked for nothing but a chance to live. His death is presented as a social murder, the result of systemic cruelty and indifference. The chapter is deeply moving and morally powerful, showing the human cost of society's failure to care for its most vulnerable members.
