Chapter 34: A Turn of the Screw

Various plot threads advance and complications develop across London. The title suggests increasing pressure being applied to different characters—screws being tightened, situations becoming more difficult and constrained. Multiple investigations and schemes are moving forward simultaneously, creating a sense of multiple forces converging.

Mr. Snagsby remains tormented by his wife's jealous suspicions. Mrs. Snagsby's paranoia hasn't abated; if anything, it has intensified. She continues to imagine conspiracies and secrets where none exist. Poor Snagsby finds no peace in his own home, constantly questioned and accused over matters he doesn't understand.

Grandfather Smallweed continues his schemes and machinations. He's still pressuring Mr. George over the debt and continues to hold various papers and documents that may be valuable. The Smallweeds are always calculating, always looking for ways to extract money or advantage from any situation.

The chapter serves as a kind of middle chapter, advancing multiple plot lines incrementally rather than containing major dramatic developments. Various investigations continue, various pressures mount, various characters find their situations becoming more difficult. The machinery of the plot is grinding forward on multiple fronts. The chapter creates a sense of gathering forces, of complications multiplying, of the novel's various storylines moving inexorably toward their collision points. The "turn of the screw" suggests that pressure is building across all the plot lines, and something must eventually give way under this accumulating strain.
