Chapter 6: Quite at Home

Life at Bleak House settles into a happy routine. Esther takes to her role as housekeeper with enthusiasm and competence, managing the household and caring for Ada and Richard. The three young people form a close family unit under John Jarndyce's benevolent guardianship. Richard must choose a profession, and after some indecision, he decides to study medicine and is articled to a surgeon in London. However, there are already hints of Richard's weakness: he doesn't seem entirely committed and speaks of medicine as just one of many possible paths.

Esther discovers that Mr. Jarndyce is her mysterious benefactor—the unknown person who paid for her education and arranged her position. She learns that he constantly performs acts of secret charity, helping people without seeking recognition or thanks. He has made a principle of doing good anonymously. This revelation deepens Esther's gratitude and affection for her guardian. She begins to understand the household's character: it's a place where practical kindness and generosity flourish.

Harold Skimpole becomes a frequent visitor, always charming and amusing but never contributing anything. His "childlike" irresponsibility begins to be more clearly seen as actual selfishness and manipulation. He cheerfully borrows money and accepts hospitality without any sense that he should reciprocate or limit his impositions.

The chapter explores Mr. Jarndyce's deep aversion to the lawsuit. Whenever Jarndyce and Jarndyce is mentioned, he speaks of the east wind—a metaphor for the corrupting influence of Chancery. He warns Richard against getting drawn into the case and shows his own determination to have nothing to do with it. The lawsuit is presented as a kind of family curse that Jarndyce is trying to protect his wards from. The chapter deepens the characterization of Jarndyce as the novel's moral center—a man of genuine goodness who puts kindness into practice.
