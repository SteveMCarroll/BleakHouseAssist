Chapter 13: Esther's Narrative

Esther narrates this chapter. Time has passed at Bleak House. Richard has already given up medicine—after only a brief period of study, he's decided it's not for him and now wants to try law instead. This career-hopping alarms Mr. Jarndyce, who sees in it a dangerous lack of steadiness and commitment. Richard's growing preoccupation with the Jarndyce and Jarndyce lawsuit is also becoming evident. He talks increasingly about his "expectations" from the case and seems to think it will make his fortune.

Esther, Ada, and Mr. Jarndyce visit London, where they encounter Jo, the crossing-sweeper, on the streets. Esther is deeply moved by Jo's poverty, homelessness, and complete illiteracy. She wants to help him, but Jo is frightened and runs away—he's used to being moved on by authorities and doesn't trust anyone. The encounter shows Esther's genuine compassion for society's most desperate outcasts.

Harold Skimpole is also present during this encounter, and his reaction to Jo is chilling. In his light, charming manner, Skimpole suggests that Jo should be swept away, gotten rid of, because he's a "bad subject." He speaks as if Jo is some sort of pest or inconvenience rather than a suffering human child. This moment reveals the ugly reality beneath Skimpole's charming exterior—his complete lack of empathy and his fundamentally selfish, even cruel worldview. While he presents himself as an innocent child, he's actually a moral monster who simply doesn't care about anyone but himself. The chapter deepens the contrast between Esther's genuine goodness and Skimpole's disguised selfishness, and shows Richard beginning his slide toward obsession with the lawsuit.
