Chapter 4: Telescopic Philanthropy

Esther arrives in London and meets two other young wards in Chancery: Ada Clare, a beautiful and gentle girl, and Richard Carstone, a handsome and cheerful young man. Both are Esther's age and will be going to Bleak House with her. The three young people immediately form a warm friendship, with Esther noting the obvious mutual attraction between Ada and Richard.

Their first night in London is spent at the home of Mrs. Jellyby, a woman obsessed with "telescopic philanthropy"—she devotes all her energy to a project to settle English families in Borrioboola-Gha on the Niger River in Africa, while completely neglecting her own household and children. The Jellyby house is in complete chaos: broken stair-rails, dirt everywhere, children running wild and neglected. Mrs. Jellyby sits surrounded by correspondence about her African project, dictating letters to her exhausted eldest daughter Caddy, while her husband wanders about in sad bewilderment and her younger children are dirty and uncared for.

Caddy Jellyby confides in Esther her misery at being used as her mother's secretary, expressing her hatred of Africa and her longing for a normal life. Poor little Peepy, Caddy's young brother, has his head stuck between iron railings and must be rescued. The chapter satirizes false charity—the kind that focuses on distant, abstract causes while ignoring immediate suffering and duty. Mrs. Jellyby represents the hypocrisy of those who claim to help humanity while failing in basic human responsibilities to their own families.

Despite the chaotic accommodation, Esther, Ada, and Richard maintain good spirits, finding humor in the situation while also being genuinely moved by the Jellybys' domestic dysfunction. The chapter establishes one of Dickens's major themes: true charity begins at home and consists of practical compassion, not grand but neglectful schemes.
