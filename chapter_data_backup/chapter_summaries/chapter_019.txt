Chapter 19: Moving On

This chapter focuses on Jo, the crossing-sweeper, and his miserable existence. "Move on" is the constant refrain—police, beadles, and various authorities are always telling Jo to "move on," but he has nowhere to go. He's homeless, illiterate, completely alone in the world, and survives by sweeping street crossings for pennies. He's sick (likely with smallpox or fever from living in Tom-all-Alone's) and getting weaker.

Mr. Snagsby, the law stationer, has taken pity on Jo. Despite his wife's jealous suspicions, Snagsby secretly helps Jo with money when he can, moved by compassion for the desperate boy. But this kindness is limited—Snagsby is too timid and too controlled by his suspicious wife to offer real, lasting help. Jo remains in the streets, constantly moved on, with no place to rest or recover from his illness.

The phrase "move on" becomes a powerful metaphor for society's treatment of its most vulnerable members. Jo isn't helped, isn't given shelter or medical care or education—he's simply moved along, pushed from place to place so he becomes someone else's problem. Every authority figure tells him to move on, but no one actually helps him.

The chapter shows Jo getting sicker and more desperate. He's been questioned about the veiled lady, which has drawn unwanted attention to him. Various people are interested in Jo for their own purposes (Tulkinghorn's investigation, Mrs. Snagsby's jealous imaginings), but no one is truly concerned for Jo's welfare. The boy who was kind enough to mourn Nemo is now himself becoming another casualty of London's indifference. His constant movement through the streets, sick and homeless, foreshadows his role in spreading the disease that will eventually affect even the protected world of Bleak House.
